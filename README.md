# MNIST-Neural-Network-Python

This code trains a neural network model to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow. The code loads the MNIST dataset, preprocesses the data, defines and compiles the neural network model, trains the model on the training data, and evaluates the model on the test data. Users can run the code in a Python environment with TensorFlow installed.
